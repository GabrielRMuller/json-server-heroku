      "lyrics": "Beyond all nightmares I met my fate\nAn ancient passage surrounded by hate\nScared I was with my hand on my cross\nI went into the demons gate\n\nAcross the Styx among the mists of Hades\nA gate of stones marks the path\nTo soul's damnation and hell's wrath\n\nAncient evil is awaiting there\nAt the doorstep to hell\nWithin it's darkness the demons dwell\n\nFrom the dark age the passage hail\nCreated by witchcraft and hate\nWhere every sinner will meet his fate\n\nThe place is cursed by the hands of doom\nUnholy powers in reign\nThe devil's paradise of pain\n\nApproach!\nThe Eibon opens for you\nThe choirs of damnation, call you on through\nThe twilight possesses, the heart of your soul\nThe starlight is fading to black, into the\nDemons gate",
